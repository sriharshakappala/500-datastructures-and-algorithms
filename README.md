## Learnings
* Mutex
* Semaphores - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)#Library_analogy
* Observer vs Publish-Subscribe
* Set, OrderedSet (or SortedSet) (collections)
* Producer-Consumer
* Remove an element that is pointed by a pointer from a singly linked list
* How LRU cache works & what datastructure it uses
* How to call a method in different ways in Ruby
* Stubs and Mocks and Fakes
* How sidekiq works
* Multithreading in Ruby
* Design a newsfeed system - schema & optimization
* Procs, Lambda, Blocks
* Sidekiq batches
* Module vs class
* When to go with synchronous / asynchronous languages?
* When to go with SQL / NOSQL datastores?
* Scale application server
* Tree Traversals - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Levelorder
* Difference between scope and class method
* Disjoint sets
* Detect cycle in Directed / Undirected graph
* Yield - Yielding to the block that is defined in the function call. The same method can be resused for different purposes by having different yield blocks
* p = Proc.new { puts "Hello" }, p.call
* Difference between PUT & POST and when to use what (idempotency)
* How hash works in O(1) complexity
* OPTIONS keyword
* Amortized Analysis - When one input changes the running time of subsequent inputs, we go for amortized analysis
* Algorithm Analysis - Best, Worst & Average case
* Dynamic Arrays (like in Ruby)
* Why array is o(1) - because it's memory is allocated in linear fashion and knowing the memory location of first will get me kth item easily
* 0/1 Knapsack
* Leaky bucket / Token Bucket
* DSL - Domain specific language
* Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)
* Optimal Substructure
* http://www.oodesign.com/
* HTTP2 - Multiplexing, Streaming, Header Compression, Default SSL
* Stored Procedures
* Stack vs Heap
* Closures in JS
* Functional Programming Language - Supports Higher Order Functions
* JS treats functions as first class citizens (like variables) - First Class Functions
* Branch Prediction - https://www.quora.com/What-is-branch-prediction-in-the-context-of-CPUs
* Eventual vs Strong / Immediate Consistency
* Go routines, Channels, Buffered Channels, Waitgroups
* Structs instead of classes in golang
* Concurrency, Ease of deployment with Go
* Datatypes in Redis
* Analyzers and Tokenizers in Elasticsearch
* Callback queues - Single or Multiple threads
* Dynamic Memory Allocation / Manual Memory Management - malloc, dealloc (optional GC like C language)
* Declarative vs Imperative
* Functional Languages
  1. Functions can't change their inputs
  2. Can't change any variables (Immutable)
  3. Loops cannot be present (as we increment counter variables)
* method_missing in Ruby
* In one line, array of integers - multiply with random number and put the original numbers in a hash with even and odd as keys (Use inject method)
* load vs require vs require_relative
* public, private, protected - protected can be called by the instance of the class and any other instance of the class as well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wG678R7ok
* Lazy Instantiation - Rails
* HTTP Headers - Cookie, SetCookie, Accept, Accept-Charset, Authentication, Authorization, Accept-Encoding, Connection, Keep-Alive, Connection, Keep-Alive

## Some items to explore
* what is mock in unit testing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUcxik0PnWY (by mock testing we can bypass some code block and make it always return true, basically whenever you mock it just doesn;t run that particular block of code)
* Mocking - Specify which functions you want to bypass
* modules and classes
* how sidekiq works
* sidekiq parallel threads
* nodejs and rails
* when to go with programming language
* what can u do in psql that u cannot do in mongo
* how to call a method in various ways
* procs blocks lambda
* nlogn or n^2 if space is not constaint - all integers

## Javascript
* Error first callbacks
* Callback hell - control flow library, like async : async await : generators with Promises
* XSS
* Timing attack
* undefined and not defined
* Hoisting
```js
var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {
  this.name = name || "";       //Public attribute default value is null
  this.company = company || ""; //Public attribute default value is null
  this.salary = salary || 5000; //Public attribute default value is null
  // Private method
  var increaseSalary = function () {
    this.salary = this.salary + 1000;
  };
  // Public method
  this.dispalyIncreasedSalary = function() {
    increaseSlary();
    console.log(this.salary);
  };
};
// Create Employee class object
var emp1 = new Employee("John","Pluto",3000);
// Create Employee class object
var emp2 = new Employee("Merry","Pluto",2000);
// Create Employee class object
var emp3 = new Employee("Ren","Pluto",2500);
```
* local and global execution context - closures, lexical scope
```js
let val = 7
function createAdder() {
  function addNumbers(a, b) {
    let ret = a + b
    return ret
  }
  return addNumbers
}
let adder = createAdder()
let sum = adder(val, 8)
console.log('example of function returning a function: ', sum)
```


Hashing Strategy
-- The hash value of the dataâ€™s key is used to find out the partition. A good hash function can distribute data uniformly across multiple partitions.

JWT
Header, Data, Signature
Libraries - jsonwebtoken, jsonwebtoken

Transposing Matrix - Make columns as rows and rows as columns

(epoch_time - number_of_seconds) gives us eooch time 10 seconds ago

Min Heap - Min Element on top of the heap
Max Heap - Max Element on top of the heap
Time Complexity for rearranging a node in Heap - O(log k), where k is number of nodes in Heap
Closures - for creating dynamic functions

```js
function makeSizer(size) {
  return function() {
    document.body.style.fontSize = size + 'px';
  };
}

var size12 = makeSizer(12);
var size14 = makeSizer(14);
var size16 = makeSizer(16);
```
